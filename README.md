# kottans_frontend

# Task 0
* Several commands were new for me: `git log`, `git diff`, `git push -u origin master`
* Command `git push -u origin master` surprised me
* I will use command `git push -u origin master`

# Task 1
Screenshots of finished cources: ![Lesson 1] (kottans_frontend/task_1/Course_1.jpg), ![Lesson 2] (./task_1/Course_2.jpg), ![Lesson 3] (./task_1/Course_3.jpg)

* All information was new for me, because I've never dealt with it closely. I've heard about command `ping`, but I didn't know what it means. Command `man` is interesting - you can read all necessary information. New approach IPv6
* Information that every packet has TTL - Time to live
* I will use command `ssh-keygen`
